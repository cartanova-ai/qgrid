## Process model

Anthropic uses fresh Claude Code process spawn per request. It does not use a persistent worker pool.

- Dispatcher: `packages/api/src/utils/providers/anthropic/anthropic-dispatcher.ts`.
- Session runner: `packages/api/src/utils/providers/anthropic/claude-session.ts`.
- Stream adapter: `packages/api/src/utils/providers/anthropic/stream-json-adapter.ts`.
- Constants/model normalization: `packages/api/src/utils/providers/anthropic/anthropic-constants.ts`.
- Process command: `claude -p ...`.
- Each request gets a fresh UUID `--session-id`.
- `workerId` is `tokenId`.
- `epoch` is always `0`.

The emitted `threadCoord` lets qgrid keep a shared response shape, but AI SDK disables `sessionKey` storage/replay for `anthropic/*` models. Do not implement Anthropic cache by pretending Claude sessions are reused unless the runtime design changes.

## Token routing

Anthropic tokens live in an in-memory `Map<tokenId, PooledToken>`.

- Startup loads active Anthropic tokens from DB.
- Token subscriber events add/update/remove entries.
- Periodic reconcile replaces pool contents from active DB rows.
- Request selection is smooth weighted round-robin over quota-eligible tokens, driven by per-token `tokens.weight` (shared selector in `providers/common/smooth-weighted-round-robin.ts`).
- Selection and score mutation run synchronously before any await, so concurrent requests observe committed prior selections and spread across tokens.

Quota threshold:

- `quota_threshold` checks `five_hour.utilization` for every model and also checks
  `seven_day_overage_included.utilization` for the Fable family (Fable 5 and 5.1,
  `isFableFamilyModel` in `anthropic-constants.ts`), using the higher utilization.
- A runtime quota-exhausted result invalidates every 60-second usage-cache key used before and
  after a possible OAuth refresh, so the next untargeted request rechecks usage and can select
  another token.
- Lookup failure is fail-open.
- If all eligible tokens exceed threshold, throw `QuotaThresholdExceededError`.

## OAuth refresh

Before spawning Claude, qgrid refreshes access tokens when expiration is within 60 seconds and a refresh token exists.

Refresh is attempted through `QgridFrame.refreshToken` with provider set to `anthropic`. Refresh failure is logged and the current access token is still tried.

## Spawn args

`buildClaudeArgs` constructs Claude Code flags:

```text
claude -p
  --tools ""
  --allowed-tools StructuredOutput        # legacy structured path only — unused since SON-532
  --disallowedTools Monitor PushNotification RemoteTrigger
  --input-format stream-json
  --output-format stream-json
  --verbose
  --include-partial-messages              # streaming path only
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions
  --setting-sources project
  --model <canonical-model-or-1m-suffix>
  --system-prompt <text>                  # small system prompt
  --system-prompt-file <path>             # large system prompt
  --thinking disabled                       # omitted for Fable 5/5.1, Opus 5 and Opus 5.5
  --effort <effort-or-low>
  --disable-slash-commands
  --session-id <uuid>
  --json-schema <schema>                  # legacy structured path only — unused since SON-532
```

Important details:

- `--tools ""` blocks normal tools on every call.
- **qgrid no longer passes `--json-schema` (SON-532).** Schema and tool-envelope contracts are
  rendered as text (`schema-prompt.ts`) and appended to the system prompt; CC runs in plain text
  mode, qgrid strips code fences (`fence-strip.ts`), and validation belongs to the consumer's zod
  and qgrid's `parseEnvelope`. The `buildClaudeArgs` structured branch remains in code but is
  unreachable from qgrid dispatch.
- `--setting-sources project` plus seeded settings isolates user configuration.
- `--system-prompt` or `--system-prompt-file` is always supplied. Omitting it would allow Claude Code default system prompt injection.
- Large system prompts over 64 KiB are written to a temporary file to avoid argv `E2BIG` — this
  same branch absorbs large injected schema contracts, so the old 64 KiB schema argv limit no
  longer applies (only the global 512 KiB caller-schema complexity limit remains).
- `--thinking disabled`, `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0`, and adaptive thinking env suppression keep thinking off for existing models. Fable 5, Fable 5.1 and Opus 5.5 require always-on adaptive thinking (Fable: CLI catalog `rejects_disabled_thinking`; Opus 5.5: official spec, thinking cannot be turned off). Opus 5 defaults to adaptive thinking and rejects disabled thinking at `xhigh`/`max` effort. qgrid omits all three suppressors for these models (`usesAdaptiveThinking`) and uses `effort` to control depth.

## Spawn env

qgrid builds a fresh env whitelist. Do not spread `process.env` into Claude child env.

Included env:

- `PATH`
- `TMPDIR`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING=1` except for Fable 5/5.1 and Opus 5
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_MDS=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BUNDLED_SKILLS=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_WORKFLOWS=1`
- `CLAUDE_CODE_ATTRIBUTION_HEADER=0`
- `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=0` except for Fable 5/5.1 and Opus 5
- `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1` when model does not support qgrid's 1M path
- `MAX_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_RETRIES` for streaming structured output only (not non-streaming `generate`)

Never pass `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or inherited auth env vars to child processes. OAuth must flow through `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.

## Config isolation

- Shared cwd: `/tmp/qgrid-anthropic`.
- Project settings file: `/tmp/qgrid-anthropic/.claude/settings.json`, written as `{}`.
- Per-token config dir: `/tmp/qgrid-anthropic-config/${tokenId}`.
- qgrid writes `{}` to both `.claude.json` and `settings.json` inside the per-token config dir before each run.

This blocks user-scope Claude settings, hooks, memory, and token cross-contamination as much as the current Claude Code interface allows.

## Timeout and cancellation

Claude sessions default to a 240-second server-side process timeout. AI SDK callers can override it
with `providerOptions.qgrid.timeoutMs`; the wire value is validated as a positive integer no greater
than 30 minutes and is applied to both `generateText` and `streamText`.

Do not substitute AI SDK's standard top-level `timeout` for this setting. AI SDK consumes that value
as its overall client budget and exposes only the resulting `abortSignal` to custom providers. The
two controls are complementary: `timeoutMs` limits the Claude process, while the AI SDK timeout also
covers client/network overhead.

Cancellation must reach the child process independently of the timer:

- AI SDK aborts cancel the qgrid HTTP request.
- Streaming SSE close aborts the provider execution.
- Non-streaming request abort or incomplete response close aborts the provider execution.
- Logged requests cancelled by disconnect finish as `aborted`, not `error`.

## Input adaptation

qgrid sends Claude stdin as JSONL with `--input-format stream-json`.

- Current input is the only executable user line.
- Prior conversation history is flattened into a single assistant context line prefixed with `Prior conversation context:`.
- Function calls and function outputs from AI SDK history are flattened into text.
- Each JSONL line is decorated with `session_id`, `uuid`, and `parent_tool_use_id: null`.

This is not equivalent to persistent Claude session reuse. It is full-history replay through a fresh process.

## Output adaptation

Claude stdout JSONL is parsed by `stream-json-adapter.ts`.

- Text mode streams `text_delta`.
- Structured mode streams `input_json_delta`. On a successful result, qgrid returns
  `result.structured_output`, because earlier assistant `StructuredOutput` inputs may be attempts
  that Claude Code rejected before an internal retry. The first tool input is retained only as a
  diagnostic fallback when no successful final structured output is available.
- `result` lines provide final text, usage, duration, cost, subtype, and terminal reason.
- Non-success subtype, `is_error`, or `terminal_reason: model_error` is treated as an error.
- Quota exhaustion is detected when text starts with `You've hit`.

Anthropic native usage categories are mutually exclusive. qgrid normalizes them into its provider-standard shape by setting:

```text
inputTokens = input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens
cachedInputTokens = cache_read_input_tokens
cacheCreationInputTokens = cache_creation_input_tokens
cacheCreationInputTokens5m = cache_creation.ephemeral_5m_input_tokens
cacheCreationInputTokens1h = cache_creation.ephemeral_1h_input_tokens
```

## Fable refusal fallback

Fable 5 and Fable 5.1 run upstream safety classifiers. A refusal is a successful HTTP response with
`stop_reason: "refusal"`, not an HTTP/provider error, and can happen before output or after
partial streamed output. Claude Code handles the refusal fallback and can retry on another Opus
model; the current CLI routes by refusal category (bio → Opus 5, cyber → Opus 4.8). Do not
hardcode the fallback target in qgrid: read it from the stream evidence below. This is distinct
from the CLI `--fallback-model` flag, which is for overload on the default model. qgrid does not
configure either mechanism or add another retry.

The stream adapter must preserve all observable routing evidence:

- `system.subtype = "model_refusal_fallback"` provides the original/fallback models and refusal details.
- `assistant.message.model` identifies the model that produced that message.
- `usage.iterations` contains the original `message` and `fallback_message` when available.
- Treat `stop_reason`, rather than `stop_details` or empty content, as the authoritative refusal signal. Category and explanation are optional metadata.
- `model_refusal_no_fallback` or a terminal `stop_reason: "refusal"` is an error, even if the outer result subtype says `success`. A successfully served fallback has a non-refusal terminal reason and a `fallback_message` iteration.

`QueryOutput.model` is the actual serving model. `requestedModel` and `modelFallbacks` preserve
the caller's requested model and routing history. Because qgrid uses a fresh Claude Code process
for each request, any Claude Code session-sticky fallback state does not carry to the next request;
each new Fable request may independently refuse and fall back again.

Cost and usage must follow the upstream combined result. Prefer Claude Code's `total_cost_usd` and
preserve `usage.iterations` only as attribution evidence; do not independently price every iteration
and add them together. An upstream pre-output refusal is not billed, while work completed before a
mid-stream refusal can be billed. Upstream fallback handling applies fallback credit where applicable,
so a qgrid-side retry would risk duplicate work and incorrect cache-write billing.

## Structured output

**Since SON-532 the anthropic route delivers schemas by prompt, not by `--json-schema`.** The
consumer's original schema (no strictify — nullish/optional intent preserved) is rendered as text
and appended to the system prompt; anthropic is cold-only, so every multi-turn step re-sends the
contract. Responses are plain text: qgrid strips fences and trims, and validation is the
consumer's zod (user schema) or qgrid's `parseEnvelope` (tool envelope). Prose or degenerate
output fails honestly — retry is the caller's decision.

Why: CC's `--json-schema` is not grammar-constrained decoding — it is a `StructuredOutput` tool
plus post-hoc AJV scoring with an internal retry loop that cannot be disabled. The strictified
scoring schema contradicted consumer intent (nullish frozen into required), so the model's
correct-per-instructions output was rejected and retried invisibly: deti transcripts showed 2–4
round trips per call, 216–512 s latency, and 4.7–9.1× billed output tokens, all collapsed into
one request-log row. OpenAI keeps the strictified schema because constrained decoding actually
enforces it there.

Legacy notes (structured path, unreachable from qgrid dispatch but still in `claude-session.ts`):
`MAX_STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_RETRIES` was pinned to 1 only for structured **streaming** calls (SON-495 —
a retry inside a stream doubles wall-clock); non-streaming kept CC's default budget because
pinning it caused 39.6% failures on `deti_production` Opus 4.8. Compliance measurement for the
prompt path lives in `scripts/schema-delivery-bench.ts`.

When a non-streaming retry succeeds, the result event's `structured_output` is the canonical
schema-validated value. Do not let a previously captured assistant tool input override it. Preserve
the first input only for non-success results such as `error_max_turns` or
`error_max_structured_output_retries`, where it is useful diagnostic evidence.

The other half of SON-495 is unchanged: any non-success subtype still sets `isError`, so a degenerate output after retries fails honestly instead of leaking partial data.

## 1M context

Model normalization strips provider prefix and `[1m]` for canonical model/cost keys.

qgrid's exact 1M support set currently includes:

- `claude-fable-5-1`
- `claude-fable-5`
- `claude-opus-5`
- `claude-opus-5-5`
- `claude-sonnet-5`
- `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `claude-opus-4-6`
- `claude-opus-4-8`

Models requiring CLI `[1m]` suffix:

- `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `claude-opus-4-6`

Unsupported `[1m]` suffixes throw early.
