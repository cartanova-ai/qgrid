## Keep Tests Lightweight

Cover user-visible flows with a small real-provider E2E suite. Keep focused tests for costs, validation, cancellation, transactions, and actual regressions that a successful live request cannot prove. Remove obsolete behavior and duplicate assertions; do not delete distinct contracts just because their tests use mocks or are long. Call counts matter when they detect duplicate generation or logging, not merely an internal implementation choice.

Prefer existing checks and fixtures. Do not add a generic harness, blanket coverage target, snapshot suite, or configuration-only test layer. After the relevant checks pass, repeat only for a new edit, failure, or concrete unresolved risk. Keep production fixes separate from test cleanup and never weaken a test to hide a discovered defect.

## Package Scripts

The commands in this section apply only inside the qgrid source repository. In a downstream
project, use that project's configured task and tool runner.

Root:

- `mise run check`: qgrid docs consistency, oxlint, and oxfmt check for the repo.
- `mise run test`: DB-free API tests, SDK tests, and CLI packaging tests. No provider credentials are needed; the OAuth relay test opens a local loopback listener.
- `mise run build`: recursive package build.
- `mise run dev`: parallel package dev servers.

API package `qgrid-api`:

- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api test:unit`: DB-free tests with per-file isolation. Add a test path to select a file.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api test:db`: model/transaction suites requiring a prepared local PostgreSQL test template. Missing DB is a failure, not a skip.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api test`: both suites, unit first.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api test:watch`: DB-free watch mode; use `test:db --watch` for DB tests.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api test:coverage`: both suites, with separate `coverage/unit` and `coverage/db` reports.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api build`: Sonamu build.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-api sonamu`: run Sonamu CLI.

AI SDK package `@cartanova/qgrid-ai-sdk`:

- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-ai-sdk test`.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-ai-sdk build`.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-ai-sdk e2e`.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-ai-sdk e2e:tools-output`.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-ai-sdk e2e:logger`.

CLI package `@cartanova/qgrid-cli`:

- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-cli build`.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter @cartanova/qgrid-cli bundle` builds the API first and copies the server bundle.

Web package `qgrid-web`:

- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-web dev`.
- `mise exec -- pnpm --filter qgrid-web preview`.

The old v1 SDK package (`packages/sdk`) has been removed from the repository; all public-SDK verification goes through `packages/ai-sdk`.

## Smoke Scripts

Real-provider E2E requires a prepared isolated qgrid server, a registered token, and explicit opt-in. It consumes subscription quota; do not run it against production as part of routine checks. Never report mocked tests as live-provider verification.

The default entry point is `packages/ai-sdk/e2e/e2e.ts` (`mise exec -- pnpm --dir packages/ai-sdk e2e`). It checks text, streaming, and tool-plus-structured output, and follows each returned `requestLogId` to the persisted parent and steps. Set `QGRID_REAL_PROVIDER_ACCEPTANCE=1`, `QGRID_URL`, and `QGRID_MODEL` explicitly. A comma-separated model list explicitly selects multiple provider runs. Each run uses a unique project label; no production logs are deleted. Exact prose, token counts, costs, and timing are not acceptance criteria.

CI runs the DB-free tests plus existing package and empty-DB boot checks. Live E2E remains an explicit command; unavailable credentials or infrastructure mean unverified, not passed.

OpenAI direct qgrid API:

- `scripts/smoke-test-openai.ts`
- Requires qgrid server and active OpenAI token.
- Uses `QGRID_URL`, default `http://localhost:44900`.
- Covers health, text generation, structured output, and qgrid-native tool-call content.

Anthropic qgrid path:

- `packages/api/scripts/smoke-test-anthropic.ts`
- Requires active Anthropic OAuth token.
- Uses `QGRID_URL`, `QGRID_ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, `QGRID_ANTHROPIC_MODELS`.
- Optional flags include `--full`, `--legacy-full`, and `--structured-stream-probe`.

AI SDK structured output:

- `scripts/qgrid-structured-ai-sdk-smoke.ts`
- Uses local `packages/ai-sdk/src/index`.
- Env: `QGRID_URL`, `SMOKE_MODEL`, `SMOKE_CASES`, `SMOKE_REPEAT`.
- Uses AI SDK 6 `streamText` with `Output.object`; useful for structured-output regressions.

AI SDK tools plus structured output:

- `packages/ai-sdk/e2e/tools-structured-output.ts`
- Focused regression probe for direct structured answers while tools are available, including OpenAI tuple output, streamed JSON, and streaming tool follow-up. The non-streaming tool execution happy path lives in the default E2E suite.
- Uses the same explicit opt-in, server, and model selection as default E2E. Runs once per mode by default; set `QGRID_ACCEPTANCE_REPEATS` only for an intentional repeated probe.

Image generation:

- `packages/api/scripts/smoke-test-image-generation.ts`
- Human-initiated only.
- Requires active OpenAI token with image entitlement and applicable migration.
- For 2.9.8 chat, verify the actual browser POST and served bundle, not only a direct function test. A globally installed CLI on port 44900 can serve stale assets while repository tests pass; identify the listening process and its executable before assuming a rebuild or refresh affects it.
- Cover auto text-only replies, native ordinary generation, server-side transparent editing, and replay of prior generated images. Explicit `true` must retain its image-required behavior. Verify driver usage stays separate from image usage and auto text replies are not image logs.
- Verify extension, decoded bytes, and natural dimensions in chat image previews. A format request in prose is not evidence: the 2026-09-29 WebP probe returned PNG from a prompt-only request and WebP from explicit `outputFormat: "webp"`. Transparent output remains PNG.
- Env: `QGRID_URL`, `QGRID_OPENAI_MODEL`.
- Not part of CI; it consumes ChatGPT subscription quota.

Other scripts under `scripts/smoke-test-*` and `scripts/debug-*` are ad hoc probes. Read the script header and env vars before running.

## Common Error Triage

Generated SSE handlers missing a newly added event field:

- Sonamu's service generator reads runtime stream-decorator schemas. A stale API `dist` can keep the old event shape even with `sonamu sync --force`.
- Run `mise exec -- pnpm --dir packages/api sonamu build api`, then `mise exec -- pnpm --dir packages/api sonamu sync --force`. Check the generated handler type and web typecheck; do not hand-edit generated services.

`NO_OPENAI_WORKERS`:

- The request path returns this only when there is no active OpenAI token candidate; there is no queue and no busy state.
- Check active OpenAI tokens and credential state (`OpenAIDispatcher.countActiveTokens()`).
- If tokens were recently changed, inspect `TokenSubscriber` status and reconcile behavior.

`NO_ACTIVE_WORKERS`:

- OpenAI token metadata exists but active tokens were deactivated.
- Check token `active` state and token subscriber event handling.

`SERVER_BUSY`:

- Removed with the permit/queue layer. Current builds never emit this error; seeing it means an old server build.

`QuotaThresholdExceededError` or `quota_threshold gate: all_exceeded`:

- All eligible tokens are above their `quota_threshold`.
- Check token thresholds and provider usage/rate-limit APIs.
- Lookup failures are fail-open, so all-exceeded means qgrid got usable over-threshold signals.

`Direct LLM API fallback not implemented`:

- Model likely lacks `openai/` or `anthropic/` prefix.
- Do not silently route prefix-less Claude model names to Anthropic.

`No anthropic tokens available`:

- Anthropic token pool is empty.
- Check active Anthropic tokens, subscriber reconcile, and token provider values.

`Claude session closed without result`:

- Claude child exited without a result line.
- Check stderr suffix in the error, spawn args, OAuth token validity, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation, and CLI version.

`error_max_structured_output_retries`:

- Claude Code structured output failed after retries.
- Treat as a real error, not a recoverable partial result.
- Check schema strictness and `stream-json-adapter` behavior.

`qgrid: imageGeneration is not supported with streamText`:

- Image generation is non-stream only. Use `generateText`.

`image generation is not supported on the Anthropic route`:

- Image generation is OpenAI/Codex-only.

`imageGeneration was requested but the response contained no image`:

- AI SDK version-skew guard. The client requested image generation, but the server returned text-only content. Check server version and the OpenAI image-generation path.

`reference image input is too large for JSON transport`:

- AI SDK reference-image guard. The client passed a base64 image data URL large enough to likely exceed qgrid's JSON request body transport. Compress or resize the image before calling `generateText`, preferably as WebP/JPEG.

`qgrid query transport failed: response headers timed out`:

- The AI SDK's request-scoped Undici `headersTimeout` for non-stream Anthropic generation expired. The message includes the effective transport budget, which is `providerOptions.qgrid.timeoutMs + 60_000`. Check whether the qgrid server stayed alive and whether its provider timeout/error response was delayed beyond that budget.

`qgrid query transport failed: connection refused`:

- The qgrid process was not accepting connections at the configured server origin. This is distinct from a long-running provider response; check the qgrid process, port, and `QGRID_URL`.

OpenAI `ImageGenerationError` kinds:

- `gate`: capability/model check failed before the turn.
- `not_called`: model completed but did not call an image tool for explicit `imageGeneration: true`. Auto mode permits text-only completion when no image tool was attempted.
- `incomplete`: image tool was attempted but no completed base64 image was produced.

`OpenAI refresh failed`:

- Inspect response body for refresh token death codes.
- If refresh token rotated but DB save failed, treat the token as at risk and require re-registration.

`re-login required`:

- Anthropic usage refresh failed and qgrid could not recover with stored refresh token.

## Debugging Rules

- Start from the package-specific tests before running smoke scripts.
- For provider issues, identify route by model prefix first.
- For cache issues, inspect opaque affinity, serialized history/prefix, provider route, and usage semantics before assuming provider cache failure.
- For dashboard metric issues, verify qgrid-standard usage fields before changing UI formulas.
- For Sonamu shape changes, verify API generated files and web consumers together.
